            <h1>Medieval Military Architecture</h1>
            <p>Surviving examples of medieval secular architecture mainly served for defense. Castles and fortified walls provide the most notable remaining non-religious examples of medieval architecture. Windows gained a cross-shape for more than decorative purposes, they provided a perfect fit for a crossbowman to safely shoot at invaders from inside. Crenellated walls (battlements) provided shelters for archers on the roofs to hide behind when not shooting invaders.</p>
           
          
            <h1>Medieval Castles</h1>
           
        <div class="text">
            
            <p>The medieval castle was the foundation of military defense for nearly a millennium. Kingdoms were caught up in an arms race to build wood and stone structures that were most effective in halting armies on campaign.</p>
        
            <h2> Motte and Bailey Castles</h2>
           <div class="text">
            <p>Motte and Bailiey castles were the earliest form of medieval castles built completely from scratch by the Normans.They consist of two parts the Motte and the Bailey.
                The Motte was a large hill that they would build a wooden keep or lookout on and the outer edge was surrounded with a large wooden fence also called a palisade.
        The Bailey was separated from the Motte by a wooden bridge that could be removed if the Bailey was occupied by enemies. The Bailey was the part of the castle where people lived and animals were kept. A large castle might have more than one Bailey.
      
                To give added protection to the castle, both the Motte and Bailey would be surrounded by a ditch, sometimes filled with water. A drawbridge was used for access to the castle.</p>

    <h2>Stone Keep Castle</h2>
    <div class="text">
        <p>This type of medieval castle soon replaced the Motte and Bailey castles as it offered a better form of defence. A stone keep was the central feature, with thick walls and few windows. Entrance to the keep was by stone steps leading to the first floor. 
            The first keeps were rectangular in shape but later ones were often circular. The Stone Keep would be surrounded by a thick stone wall containing turrets for lookouts.
            
            The Bailey was now the area outside the keep but within the outer walls and shelter for animals or craft workshops might be built against the walls. The entire castle might be surrounded by a ditch or moat and entrance to the castle was by drawbridge.</p>

     <h2>The Concentric castle </h2>
     <div class="text">
        <p>The Concentric castle was developed in the 12th and 13th Centuries and offered the best protection against attack.

            The main feature of the concentric medieval castle is its walls. An inner wall built of thick stone with turrets positioned at intervals is then surrounded by an equally thick but lower stone wall. The walls are built at different levels so that archers on the inner walls can fire over the archers on the outer walls.
            
            The space between the two walls was known as the "death hole" for being trapped within the walls would almost certainly result in death for the attacker. The entire castle was then often surrounded with a moat and entry would be across a drawbridge.</p>

    <h1>Defensive wall</h1>
    <div class="text">
        <p>A defensive wall is a fortification usually used to protect a city, town or other settlement from potential aggressors. The walls can range from simple palisades or earthworks to extensive military fortifications with towers, bastions and gates for access to the city.</p>
